# Welcome!

This is my personal portfolio website!

I built this using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and am currently hosting it using Github Pages. 

I plan to showcase projects I have worked on in both the Computer Science/programming side and the UX/Design side.

Check it out at [sarahchou.github.io](sarahchou.github.io).
