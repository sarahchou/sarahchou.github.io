								team and I won the award sponsored by the Boston Women's Workforce Council: Hack the Gender Gap Challenge.
							More information about the challenge and its judging criteria can be found <a href="https://boston.techtogether.io/2019/live/prizes.html">here</a>.
							Our inspiration for this project was simply to find a way to organize some data about the wage gap, 
							and gain insight using visualizations in Tableau.
							We used MySQL to filter the data and conduct initial queries on the raw data. We used Tableau to
							 build the charts that display our findings in a visually appealing manner so 
							 that we could see trends and patterns. 
							The website was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap.

						<p>This is an Android app	I helped build at <a href="https://pearlhacks.com/">PearlHacks 2017</a>, an all-female hackathon at UNC Chapel Hill in North Carolina.
							I worked with a team of 2 other students. This project was awarded the prize for "Best Mobile Application" and "Best Use of the Bandwidth Texting or Calling API". 
							This was one of my first hackathons that I attended, and it was great to work on a meaningful project that won awards!
							We created P.U.S.H. - Preventing Unwanted Social Harassment - as a way to avoid dangerous social situations for women. 
							Users of the app can simply click on a push notification at the top of their phone screen if they feel they are in danger, and their friend group (pre-selected at the beginning of the night out),
							will be notified of a pre-selected message to send help. We used Java to create the Android app and the <a href="https://www.bandwidth.com/glossary/sms-api/">Bandwidth API</a> for texting purposes.

					<p>Holibot is a <a href="https://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> texting bot I helped build at 
						<a href="https://superposition.tech/">Superposition II 2018</a>, an 
						all-female hackathon for middle, high school, and college females in the Bay Area.
						I worked with one other high school student, and our project was awarded the prize for "Best Pitch". 
						We found out about the Twilio API through a presentation at this hackathon and were excited to try it out. 
						 The purpose behind the bot was a little silly, but it was fun to work on! We created a texting bot that would 
						text back random national holidays that fell on the date the user texted to it. We used this <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/fun/">list of random national holidays</a> and 
						 the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms">Twilio API</a> and created a Flask app implementing logic to read in data from two text files (one that has all of the dates of weird holidays and one that has all of the weird
						 holidays listed) and create a python dictionary. We then created a method that, 
						 given a date, will return the holiday of that date. Finally, utilizing 
						 the Twilio API, we were able to check if the date texted is a date in our dictionary, 
						 respond back with an SMS message of the corresponding holiday!

			</div>
				<p>EatThisBot is a&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/EatThisBot">Twitter bot account</a> 
					that my friend Jamie and I developed at BostonHacks 2019. We wanted to learn how to create a Twitter bot, as avid and active Twitter
					users ourselves, and used this hackathon as a way to learn!
					We built this using JavaScript and a platform called Glitch (see <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/rainy-zone">here</a> for an example). We used Uptime Robot to schedule HTTP requests every 4 hours which 
					triggers Glitch to send a tweet to a new Twitter account (@EatThisBot) that we created. Our JavaScript file uses a randomizer to first choose 
					a sentence structure from the different options that we wrote, and then completes the sentence with word variables. 
					We have lists of different types of words (e.g. a list of foods, a list of adjectives, a list of amounts, etc.) to 
					help fill in the blanks with words that will make a syntactically correct sentence, but that might not be semantically correct.
					This bot randomly generates a tweet once every specific interval of time (we set it to once every 4 hours for now but 
					it can be as frequent as every 5 minutes). The tweets consist of a random sentence structure and random words
					 that we wrote to fill in the blanks of the sentences.
		Check out our <a href="https://devpost.com/software/eatthisbot">DevPost</a> submission for more information on this project, and follow us on Twitter
