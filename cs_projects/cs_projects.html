								<p>Here is a link to my&nbsp;<a href="https://devpost.com/sarahchou"> Devpost</a>, 
									which has projects I worked on at hackathons like BostonHacks, Superposition II, SheHacks Boston, and TechTogether Boston.</p>
								<p>Here is a link to my&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/sarahchou"> Github</a>, 
									which has repositories of some projects I have worked on both inside the classroom and outside the classroom.</p>
                <p>I plan on uploading more of my work soon, as this 
									website is still a work in progress.</p>

								<p>This is a&nbsp;<a href="https://sarahchou.github.io/GenderPayGap/index.html">website</a> 
									I worked on at&nbsp;<a href="https://boston.techtogether.io/2019/index.html">TechTogether Boston 2019</a>. My 
								team and I won the award sponsored by the Boston Women's Workforce Council: Hack the Gender Gap Challenge.
							More information about the challenge and its judging criteria can be found <a href="https://boston.techtogether.io/2019/live/prizes.html">here</a>.
							Our inspiration for this project was simply to find a way to organize some data about the wage gap, 
							and gain insight using visualizations in Tableau.
							We used MySQL to filter the data and conduct initial queries on the raw data. We used Tableau to
							 build the charts that display our findings in a visually appealing manner so 
							 that we could see trends and patterns. 
							The website was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap.

					and our <a href="https://devpost.com/software/hack-the-gap">Devpost</a> submission with more insights on challenges we faced and what we are proud of.</p>

							<p>This is a&nbsp;<a href="https://sarahchou.github.io/BostonCrimeDatabase/">website</a> 
								I worked on for my CS3200 Database Design class. I worked with a team of 4 other students.
						Our inspiration for this project was simply to find a way to organize and visualize data from this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ankkur13/boston-crime-data">Boston Crime dataset</a>, 
						and gain insight using visualizations in Tableau.
						We used MySQL to filter the data and conduct initial queries on the raw data. We used Tableau to

						<div id="cs-proj-img-vert">
									<img src="push.png" id="cs-proj-img-vert">
							</div>
						<p>This is an Android app	I helped build at <a href="https://pearlhacks.com/">PearlHacks 2017</a>, an all-female hackathon at UNC Chapel Hill in North Carolina.
							I worked with a team of 2 other students. This project was awarded the prize for "Best Mobile Application" and "Best Use of the Bandwidth Texting or Calling API". 
							This was one of my first hackathons that I attended, and it was great to work on a meaningful project that won awards!
							We created P.U.S.H. - Preventing Unwanted Social Harassment - as a way to avoid dangerous social situations for women. 
							Users of the app can simply click on a push notification at the top of their phone screen if they feel they are in danger, and their friend group (pre-selected at the beginning of the night out),
							will be notified of a pre-selected message to send help. We used Java to create the Android app and the <a href="https://www.bandwidth.com/glossary/sms-api/">Bandwidth API</a> for texting purposes.
