                <p>I plan on uploading more of my work soon, as this

								<p>This is a&nbsp;<a href="https://sarahchou.github.io/GenderPayGap/index.html">website</a> 
									I worked on at&nbsp;<a href="https://boston.techtogether.io/2019/index.html">TechTogether Boston 2019</a>. My 
								team and I won the award sponsored by the Boston Women's Workforce Council: Hack the Gender Gap Challenge.
							More information about the challenge and its judging criteria can be found <a href="https://boston.techtogether.io/2019/live/prizes.html">here</a>.
							Our inspiration for this project was simply to find a way to organize some data about the wage gap, 
							and gain insight using visualizations in Tableau.
							We used MySQL to filter the data and conduct initial queries on the raw data. We used Tableau to
							 build the charts that display our findings in a visually appealing manner so 
							 that we could see trends and patterns. 
							The website was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap.
						Check out our <a href="https://github.com/sarahchou/GenderPayGap">Github</a> repo for this project
					and our <a href="https://devpost.com/software/hack-the-gap">Devpost</a> submission with more insights on challenges we faced and what we are proud of.</p>
