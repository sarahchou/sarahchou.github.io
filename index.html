				<p>Welcome to my website! I created this site using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Flexbox. This website is still a work in progress, so stay tuned as I update it! I have 
					visions for how I would like it to look, and am learning new front-end development skills each day 
					that I work on this.</p>
					
					<p>The goal of this site is to serve as a <b>portfolio </b> of the projects I have worked on, 
							both inside the classroom and out. I've worked on several <b>class projects</b> (in Database Design, Interaction Design, Human Computer Interaction, and more!) that I am
							proud to showcase. I have also worked on <b>side projects at hackathons</b>, or in my own free time, to learn new technologies, frameworks, and skills. </p>
							 
					<p>As a student with a combined major and a minor, I have indisciplinary skills and interests.
						 I have coded programs, designed interfaces, and prototyped experiences. I enjoy problem solving through code, I like 
						coming up with solutions to issues that people face everyday, and I love understanding users empathetically. My goal as 
					a programmer, designer, and engineer, is to create solutions with <b>user-centered design</b> as a primary focus.</p>
