				<div class="col-md-offset-1">
					<p id="subs"> My name is Sarah and I am a Computer Science/Cognitive Psychology major at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. I was 18 years old when I created this page during NUWIT's Personal Website Hack Day on February 20, 2016. It was my very first time being exposed to the world of web development, HTML, CSS, and GitHub. It was a very fun and engaging learning experience, but I was only able to accomplish so much during the 4 hour workshop. A few months later, I went to a Web App Workshop at Hubspot in Cambridge, where I then developed a more advanced personal website, which can be found here: www.sarahchou.com. Thanks for checking this page out! </p>

					<p id="subtitle"> Favorites/About Me </p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-offset-1">
					<p id="subs"> My two favorite foods are chocolate and potatoes (but not together!). My favorite thing to do in my free time is take pictures of and with people. I have a Canon Rebel t3i, and while I wouldn't consider myself a true "photographer" yet, I am working on developing my portrait photography skills. My favorite sports teams are all from the Bay Area, I've got to rep where I come from, especially now that I'm temporarily in Boston (another great place for sports!). But my favorite sport is gymnastics. I love watching during the Olympics of course, but also love watching Team USA during other international competitions, and keeping up with NCAA Women's gymnastics. I also competed in high school, and have been taking recreational adult gymnastics classes on the side.   </p>

					<p id="subtitle"> Goals </p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-offset-1">
					<p id="subs"> My goals for this page were originally to revamp it, but I decided to navigate my efforts to improving my other website: www.sarahchou.com. My technical goals for myself include familiarizing myself with various aspects of Computer Science (there is so much to learn!) and learning more programming languages, such as Python, Javascript, C++, bash, etc. Currently I am pretty good with Java and know a little bit of bash and Python, but I'd like to practice more and become proficient. Other goals include diving into the world of mobile development. I helped with the creation of one Android app at a hackathon, but I would love to learn more about iOS development also. My long term goal for my career is to work at a place with great company culture, wonderful people, with a mission that I can get behind (and hopefully located in the San Francisco area).  </p>
