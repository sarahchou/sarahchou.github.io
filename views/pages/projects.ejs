      <h1>Coding is awesome!</h1>
      <p>Coding is like magic. I love to create new projects that are useful and fun. Making these projects was a great learning process for me.</p>

          <h3>Tetris</h3>
          <p>In Fundies 1, we created the well known game of Tetris from scratch using BSL in Racket. </p>

        <h3>Maze Game</h3>
        <p>In this game, we used Breadth First Search and Depth First Search to solve a maze. This was coded in Java. </p>

        <h3>Apple Game</h3>
        <p>In Fundies 2, I made a Falling Apples Game using Java, where the goal was to catch 10 falling apples in a basket by moving the arrow keys. Although the objective of the game is simple, I learned a lot about Java and different classes and methods necessary to create games.</p>

        <h3>Forbiddden Island World</h3>
        <p>This game was also a Fundies 2 assignment, where my partner and I made an idland that shrunk onTick, and the goal was for the pilot to create all of the helicopter pieces that were scattered across the island before the water washed it away. </p>

        <h3>FreeCell</h3>
        <p>In Object Oriented Design, I coded the game of Freecell with Java in IntelliJ. We used the Model-View-Controller software architectual pattern to complete the game. I had two different models for this game, where one allowed only single card moves, while the other allowed multi card moves with a valid build of opposite color and decreasing valued cards. </p>

        <h3>Music Editor</h3>
        <p>In Object Oriented Design, I created a music editor with a partner. Our music editor took in a midi file and provided console, visual, audible, and composite "views" using Java Swing and Java MIDI libraries. We used the MVC pattern to create the complete project. </p>

        <h3>P.U.S.H. Android App</h3>
        <p>At PearlHacks at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, I helped develop an Android mobile application with two friends. Our app used the Bandwidth API for calling and texting and allowed users to immediately notify a group of friends if they were in danger with a customized text message with the simple tap of a push notification that was always on their screen. I came up with the idea and also designed the User Interface. This was my first hackathon and my first time interacting with Android Studio and mobile development. Our app won "Best Mobile App" and "Best Use of Bandwidth API for Calling and Texting" out of almost 50 submissions.  </p>

        <h3>Age Recognition iOS App</h3>
        <p>At HackBeanpot, a friend and I developed an iOS application that allowed users to take a photo or upload from their camera roll, and it would change the background of the app. Our initial idea was to use IBM's Bluemix API for facial recognition to then give data on the subject of the photo, but we haven't quite gotten there yet. It was our first time experiementing with the language Swift and XCode as an IDE, and we definitely learned a lot! </p>
