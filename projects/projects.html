					<p id="project-text">I designed a decision making app for my Interaction Design: Mobile class.</p>
					<p id="project-text">The first step in the process was to research existing apps, and find a good app example and a bad app example. I then 
						documented the UI Flow for both apps, comparing how simple or complicated the process was. Next, I created a UI Spec for what I wanted my
						improved app to look like. With minimal colors, I tried to focus mainly on features the app would contain, and which buttons and links would 
						lead to which pages. Next, I created a VD Spec, which included colors and branding, such as font styles and sizes.
						I then created paper prototypes to test on potential users (fellow classmates). I was able to gain valuable feedback from their experiences working
						with the prototypes. This led me to my final prototype, where I implemented the colors from my VD Spec as well as the feedback from my user testing.

						<h4>Event Browsing App</h4>

						<p id="project-text">I designed an event browsing app based on an interests profile for my Interaction Design: Mobile class.</p>
						<p id="project-text">The first step in the process was to conduct user research to come up with an idea. The prompt was to focus on the elderly population, so I interviewed
							my greay aunt, my second cousin who lives with my great aunt, and my father, all ranging in ages 45-78 years old. Through each of these phone interviews, we discussed ideas for apps
							that they currently used that could use improvement, or apps they wished they had that would improve their everyday lives. The two ideas I narrowed my search down to were a pill reminder
							app, or an app to search for nearby events based on interests. I was leaning towards the pill reminder app, but after doing market research, I found that there were many apps that did
							what I was trying to do perfectly already. I decided to focus on an events app.
						</p>
						<p id="project-text">After conducting my initial user research, I came up with a Brand Identity, including creating a logo, choosing colors, and deciding on fonts. I later changed the font style I used, but this was a starting point.
							I also did market research and creating a brand audit, where I looked for other apps that had features I was looking for. There were not many apps that catered to elderly people with respect to events.

							<h4>TA Portal Website</h4>

							<p id="project-text">I designed a website for TAs to connect with each other for my Interaction Design: Responsive class.</p>
							<p id="project-text">The first step in the process was to brainstorm a problem to come up with an idea.
								I was a TA for CS1200 at Northeastern, and a problem I was experiencing in that role was not being able to communicate
								with fellow TAs or professors or advisors aside from email. I didn't even know who was a TA, so when I had a question, I wasn't 
								sure who to ask. I decided to create a website called TA Portal to have a common space for TAs to communicate about lesson plans,
								concerns, tips and ideas for upcoming classes. Throughout the design process, I conducted user interviews, created clickable wireframes,
								received feedback from users, decided on fonts and came up with a logo, and had many different layouts that I presented during class critiques
								before landing on my final website layout. I learned a lot during this process, and you can see the highlights in the PDF below.
