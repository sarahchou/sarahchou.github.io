				<p>I redesigned a flyer that my friend made to pass out to older folk in her New Jersey community to inform them about the Black Lives Matter movement, since they don't use social media.</p>
				<p>I used <b>InDesign</b> to reformat the flyer, using hierarchy and different type faces to emphasize key points. I also utilized black and brown color choices to emphasize the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

			<h3 id="cs-proj-title">Decision Making App</h3>

			<p>I designed a decision making app for my Interaction Design: Mobile class.</p>
			<p id=project-text><b>UX Process Summary:</b></p>

			<p>The first step in the process was to research existing apps, and find a good example of a decision making app (IDK), and a bad example of a decision making app (ProsCons). 
				I screenshotted the workflows of each app, and then documented the UI workflows, comparing how simple or complicated the process was. The good app, IDK, had a much simpler workflow and cleaner UI, which made
				it easier to use.
				
					 This led me to my final prototype, where I implemented the colors from my VD Spec as well as the feedback from my user testing.</p>
			
			<p id=project-text><b>Existing App (Bad): "ProsCons"</b></p>
			<p id=project-text>Screenshots of the bad app workflow. The user interface was not attractive, there were ads in the corner, and the scroll bar at the bottom
				of the page was not interactive, even though it looked like it was moveable.
			</p>
			<div class=container>

			<div class=container>
				<img src="decisions/bad-ex-2.png" id="example-img">
			</div>

			<p id=project-text><b>Existing App UI Workflow (Bad): "ProsCons</b></p>
			<p id=project-text>This workflow was confusing and circular, and had numerous unnecessary pages.</p>

			<div class=container>
				<img src="decisions/UIWorkflow_proscons.png" id="example-img">
			</div>
			<p id=project-text><b>Existing App (Good): "IDK"</b></p>
			<p id=project-text>The UI was friendly, colorful, and easy to use and understand. The emoticons were related to the decisions and the page split was helpful.
				
			</p>

			<p id=project-text><b>Existing App UI Workflow (Good): "IDK"</b></p>
			<p id=project-text>The workflow was easy, simple and straightforward.</p>

			<div class=container>
				<img src="decisions/UIWorkflow_IDK.png" id="example-img">
			</div>
			<p id=project-text><b>UI Spec</b></p>

			<p>Next, I created a UI Spec for what I wanted my improved app to look like. With minimal colors, I tried to 
				focus mainly on features the app would contain, and which buttons and links would 
					lead to which pages. The pink text showcases how the workflow works, and arrows point to where buttons lead. </p>

			<p id=project-text><b>VD Spec</b></p>
			<p>Next, I created a VD Spec, which included colors and branding, such as font styles and sizes. This does not include all of the 
				final colors and fonts, but it was a brand guideline for me to use. 
			</p>

			<div class=container>
				<img src="decisions/VDSpec.png" id="example-img">
			</div>

			<p id=project-text><b>Paper Prototyping</b></p>
			<p>I then created a paper prototype of my app to test on potential users (fellow classmates). Users were able to move a paper cut out phone screen to indicate where they were in the process. I also had
				sticky notes where they were able to write in what they would type in input fields. Users used their fingers to point to areas on the screen that they wished to click on.
				I was able to gain valuable feedback from their experiences working
					with the prototypes. Key takeaways included: 
					<div class=container>
					<ul id=resume-text>
							<li>one user suggested adding tags for the types of decisions (school, work, social, etc.)</li>
							<li>users did not like the dragging action (card for reason) and did not understand it without a tutorial or explanation</li>
							<li>users did not think
									the refresh was necessary and it should just be a delete or an x button to close</li>
							<li>users suggested adding a "Statistics" page 
									instead of having a verdict and decision crowding the space</li>
						  </ul>

				<h3 id="cs-proj-title">Event Browsing App</h3>
					<p>I designed an event browsing app based on an interests profile for my Interaction Design: Mobile class.</p>
					<p id=project-text><b>UX Process Summary:</b></p>

					<p>The first step in the process was to conduct user research to come up with an idea. The prompt was to focus on the elderly population, so I interviewed
						my greay aunt, my second cousin who lives with my great aunt, and my father, all ranging in ages 45-78 years old. Through each of these phone interviews, we discussed ideas for apps
						that they currently used that could use improvement, or apps they wished they had that would improve their everyday lives. The two ideas I narrowed my search down to were a pill reminder
						app, or an app to search for nearby events based on interests. I was leaning towards the pill reminder app, but after doing market research, I found that there were many apps that did
						what I was trying to do perfectly already. I decided to focus on an events app.
					</p>
					<p>After conducting my initial user research, I came up with a Brand Identity, including creating a logo, choosing colors, and deciding on fonts. I later changed the font style I used, but this was a starting point.
						I also did market research and creating a brand audit, where I looked for other apps that had features I was looking for. There were not many apps that catered to elderly people with respect to events.
					</p>
					<p id=project-text><b>User Interviews</b></p>
					<div class=container>
							<ul id=resume-text>
									<li>I conducted interviews targeting older populations of mobile phone users</li>
									<li>I interviewed 3 relatives of various ages (ranging from 38-78 years old) over the phone</li>
									<li>I asked about current phone app usage and potential future apps they wished to have</li>

					<p id=project-text><b>Service Identity and Branding Guidelines</b></p>
					<p>I created a service identity and branding guidelines with color choices and font choices for my app. The font choices were not
						final, and changed in the final prototype. I stuck with the wine color as my main app color, because this is a color I did not see
					on many mobile apps and wanted my app to stand out. I created a logo in Illustrator, with a calendar and question mark, and the name What2Do
				to capture the essence of finding events and filling a schedule. </p>
				<div class=container>
						<img src="what2do/service-identity.png" id="example-img">
				</div>

				<p id=project-text><b>Market Research</b></p>
					<p>I conducted market research to see if there were apps that were similar to what I had in mind. I coudl only find
						three other apps in the Apple app store that catered towards events for elderly people. I compared their functionality
						and features with features that I wanted to implement in my app. The apps on the market fell short of what I wanted to include, 
						so this was a gap in the market. (The light colored dots indicate that the app comes close to achieving the feature, but it is slightly different).

				<p id=project-text><b>Service Concept</b></p>
					<p>Creating a service concept helped to describe why someone would need to use this app to enhance their life.
					</p>
				<div class=container>
						<img src="what2do/service-concept.png" id="example-img">

				<p id=project-text><b>Personas</b></p>
					<p>Coming up with personas helped to create examples of people that would use the app, and are characters that will be used in my hero's journey and storyboard 
						later on. 
					</p>

						<img src="what2do/persona-2.png" id="example-img">
				</div>
				<p id=project-text><b>Hero's Journey</b></p>
					<p>The hero's journey shows different steps in the process of using this app, from the start, where a problem is identified, to the middle,
						where the app is found as a solution, to the end, where the person has changed as a result of using the app. It also shows how the user might want or need
						different features in the app in order for them to remain a user, or keep coming back. I created this using InDesign.

				<div class=container>
						<img src="what2do/heros-journey.png" id="example-img">
				</div>

				<p id=project-text><b>Storyboard</b></p>
					<p>Storyboarding an example of my example user using the app helps identify pain points and how using the app will enahnce their life. 
						It follows the hero's journey. There are also places below the comic that allow for some user interfacing on mobile screens. I kept these 
						small to avoid too much detail work, to keep these ideas high level.

				<p id=project-text><b>VD Spec</b></p>
					<p>The VD Spec shows fonts, colors, and sizes to be used within the app. It follows the service identity and branding guidelines 
						from above. Some changes were made, such as the font type. Also, later on, based on feedback, I changed the active button to be colored burgandy 
						to further enhance it, as opposed to dark gray.

				<h3 id="cs-proj-title">TA Portal Website</h3>
					<p>I designed a website for TAs to connect with each other for my Interaction Design: Responsive class.</p>
					<p>The first step in the process was to brainstorm a problem to come up with an idea.
						I was a TA for CS1200 at Northeastern, and a problem I was experiencing in that role was not being able to communicate
						with fellow TAs or professors or advisors aside from email. I didn't even know who was a TA, so when I had a question, I wasn't 
						sure who to ask. I decided to create a website called TA Portal to have a common space for TAs to communicate about lesson plans,
						concerns, tips and ideas for upcoming classes. Throughout the design process, I conducted user interviews, created clickable wireframes,
						received feedback from users, decided on fonts and came up with a logo, and had many different layouts that I presented during class critiques
						before landing on my final website layout. I learned a lot during this process, and you can see the highlights in the PDF below.
